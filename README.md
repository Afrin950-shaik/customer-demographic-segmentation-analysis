# Customer Demographic and Segmentation Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer demographic data to identify age groups, income levels, and buying patterns using descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to derive actionable insights that can help businesses improve customer targeting and decision-making.

##  Objective
- Understand customer demographics such as age, gender, and income
- Segment customers into meaningful groups
- Analyze buying patterns across different demographic segments
- Provide business recommendations based on data-driven insights

##  Dataset
- Source: Customer Segmentation Dataset  
- Features used:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Annual Income
  - Spending Score

The dataset contains demographic attributes along with spending behavior, making it suitable for customer segmentation analysis.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Methodology
1. Data loading and validation
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Age group segmentation
4. Income level segmentation
5. Descriptive statistical analysis
6. Buying pattern analysis
7. Data visualization
8. Insight generation and interpretation

##  Key Analysis Performed
- Descriptive statistics to summarize age, income, and spending behavior
- Age group analysis to compare average spending across different age ranges
- Income level analysis to understand purchasing power and behavior
- Visualizations to support insights and improve interpretability

##  Key Visualization
- Average Spending by Age Group  
  File: visuals/age_group_spending.png  
  This visualization shows how customer spending behavior varies across different age segments.

##  Key Insights
- Customers aged 36–45 show higher average spending compared to other age groups
- High income does not always correspond to the highest spending behavior
- Low-income customers form a significant and stable customer segment

##  Business Recommendations
- Focus targeted marketing campaigns on high-spending age groups
- Design loyalty programs for middle-income customers
- Introduce premium offerings tailored to high-income segments

##  Conclusion
This project demonstrates how customer demographic analysis combined with descriptive statistics can uncover meaningful customer segments and support informed business strategies.
